This project focuses on predicting the **yearly amount spent by customers** on an e-commerce platform using **Linear Regression**. The goal is to understand which features most influence customer spending and build a regression model to accurately forecast future spending.

## Project Objective

The objective was to analyze user behavior data and predict their yearly spending based on the following features:

- Average Session Length  
- Time on App  
- Time on Website  
- Length of Membership  

By understanding these relationships, businesses can better tailor their marketing and platform strategies.

## What I Did

- Loaded and explored the dataset to understand the structure and significance of each feature.
- Performed data cleaning, including checking for null values and verifying data types.
- Visualized relationships between features using scatter plots, joint plot, pair plot and lmplot.
- Prepared the data for machine learning by splitting it into training and testing sets.
- Built and trained a Linear Regression model to predict yearly spending.
- Evaluated model performance using common regression metrics.

## Model Performance

The model was evaluated using the test set and achieved the following results:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 8.43  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 103.92  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 10.19  
- RÂ² Score: 0.981  

These metrics show that the model is highly accurate in predicting how much a customer is likely to spend yearly, based on their behavior and engagement with the app and website.

## Final Outcome

This project demonstrates how linear regression can be used effectively for predictive analytics in e-commerce. The trained model provides valuable insights into customer behavior and spending trends, and it can serve as a strong foundation for further business intelligence or marketing applications.
